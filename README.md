Objective: Interface a DHT sensor with an Arduino to accurately measure temperature and humidity, and display the readings in real-time on either an LCD screen or a serial monitor.
==
Key Activities:

1.Sensor Setup: Connect the DHT sensor (DHT11 or DHT22) to the Arduino according to the sensor's datasheet and Arduino pin configuration.
2.Arduino Programming: Write Arduino code to read data from the DHT sensor using appropriate libraries (e.g., DHT library). This involves initializing the sensor, reading temperature and humidity values, and storing them in variables.
3.LCD Screen: Connect an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen (like HD44780) to the Arduino. Program the Arduino to display temperature and humidity readings on the LCD screen.
. Serial Monitor: Alternatively, display the sensor readings on a computer via the Arduino's serial communication. Use Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor or a similar terminal program to view the data.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
. Arduino: Microcontroller platform used for interfacing with the DHT sensor and output devices.
. DHT Sensor (DHT11/DHT22): Digital sensor for measuring temperature and humidity.
. Arduino IDE: Integrated Development Environment used for programming the Arduino board.
. LCD Screen (HD44780): Display device for showing real-time sensor data.
